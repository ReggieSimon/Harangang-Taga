# Harangang-Taga by BrinRot Studios 
Harangang-Taga is a top-down casual game, where you are immersed into a rural town somewhere in the Philippines. You play as Joven - a rowdy kid with his friends. Joven and his friends are challenged to a game of Harangang-Taga on a random afternoon in their lovely neighborhood.

* Game Title: Harangang-Taga
* Genre: Top-down 2D-pixel casual game
* Inspiration: Patintero (Traditional Filipino Game)

## Core Features
* AI Defenders: The AI Defenders' primary function is to block players by moving toward the nearest one within their designated range.
Each AI has a detection radius, and when a player enters this radius, the AI locks on to them and follows their movement until either the player escapes the radius or is tagged.
* Player vs AI System: Players must outmaneuver the AI Defenders by dodging their movements and staying out of their detection range.
Players can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right), and the challenge lies in timing and precision to avoid being tagged by the AI.
* Winning Condition: The game employs a cooperative win condition, where only one player must reach the end and return to the starting point for the team to win.
The objective is to cross the field without getting tagged by AI Defenders.
* Level Design and Progression: The game is structured around levels where the difficulty increases with the number of AI Defenders and the complexity of the defenders (their speed, reach, etc.).
